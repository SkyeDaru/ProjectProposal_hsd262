# PROJECT TITLE: 'Broke Millenial' 

#What and Why / For Whom?

'Broke Millenial' is a web-based application that serves to alleviate the financial 
& emotional stress that comes with being a hopeless, indecisive member of the Generations Y (and Z)...Forget the self-help
books! This application goes beyond your basic personal budget-tracking/expenses management system; 
In fact, 'Broke Millenial' helps users make life's BIG decisions by allowing them to plan out what their financial situation 
would look like in several potential scenarios. For many young adults in between the ages of 20-30, 
the big question of "What's your next move?" often arises, especially for those who are facing major milestones such as 
college graduation. The matter of fact is that it is difficult to accurately picture what your life would look like without 
first having some sort of foreshadowing of 'the health' of your bank account. How much money will I have to my name if 
I...Take a gap year and live in Hawaii? Or accept that six-figure job in NYC with loans? Perhaps ditch rent and move back in 
with my parents? Maybe forget the gap year, I'm going straight into Graduate School? Whatever options you are currently  
weighing,'Broke Millenial' has you covered. Let us map out your future by displaying and analyzing your prospective: total 
cost of living, monthly salary, transportation/grocery expenses (by state), rent, etc. We'll show you how much money you have
to your name based on the specified information you provide.

# How and Scope
From a user's perspective, he or she will be lead to a page with two options: One option is to 'track the present' which 
includes the basic functions of a personal finances management system. This includes features that allow you to both display    
and set budgets or expenses in an organized manner. Examples of this option would be along the lines of apps such as Quicken
or Mint. The second option is to plan the 'future' where users are able to create an unlimited number of potential scenarios.
This entails having the user input where they plan to live, how much income they will be making, and any other common expenses
(cell phone plan, groceries, etc). When all scenarios are filled in, users will be able to compare which situation is more
affordable, with the hopes of helping users answers the questions: "Can I financially afford to make X decision?" This 
platform can even go as far as supplying state-based data (extracted from internet or other source) when a user inputs where 
they plan to live (i.e average cost of living in Los Angeles vs average cost of living in Ohio). 
I believe this proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitious as it involves working with large sets of data, creating
an algorithm to track finances, and user input/output. Additionally, there are enough functions in this web app to be split
among four to five programmers.
